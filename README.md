A powerful web interface for manipulating Factorio blueprint strings. This tool allows players to decode encrypted blueprint strings into readable JSON, modify them using an advanced code editor, and re-encode them back for use in the game. It is essential for debugging blueprints or making complex bulk edits that are impossible in-game.

## Features

* **Blueprint Conversion**: Instantly decodes compressed Factorio strings (zlib/base64) into formatted JSON and encodes them back.
* **Advanced JSON Editor**: Integrated **CodeMirror** editor features syntax highlighting, bracket matching, and auto-formatting for easy navigation.
* **Search & Replace**: Built-in tools to find specific values or replace text globally within the blueprint JSON.
* **History System**: Automatically saves the last 30 decoded blueprints to local storage, allowing quick restoration of previous sessions.
* **Format Validation**: Ensures the JSON structure is valid before re-encoding to prevent game errors.

## Installation and Usage

1.  Clone the repository or download the source files.
2.  Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
3.  Paste your Factorio blueprint string into the top text area.
4.  Click **"DECODE"** to view and edit the JSON structure.
5.  After editing, click **"ENCODE"** to generate the new string.
